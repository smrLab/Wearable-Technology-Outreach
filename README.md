# SMRL Wearable Technology Outreach Workshop

## Project Description
This repo summarizes all the steps you will need for the outreach project. The repo contains two folders:
- **Trinket M0- Human Computer Interface** here you will create a wearable sleeve with capacitive touch sensors that can be mapped to the W-A-S-D keys or LEDs.
- **Trinket M0- LED Display** here you will create a wearable sleeve or beanie with LEDs that will blink in different patterns.

## Installing the code editor:
1. You can edit and upload the code using Mu. Installation instructions can be found here: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-trinket-m0-circuitpython-arduino?view=all#installing-mu-editor
2. Mu contains a serial console to allow you to display output text using a "print statement". See line 14 in the main.py file.
3. The other feature of the serial connection is the Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop (REPL): https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-trinket-m0-circuitpython-arduino?view=all#the-repl

## Updating the CircuitPython version on your Trinket M0:
1. Hook your Trinket M0 up to a computer with a known-good USB data cable, and double-tap the button on the end to bring up the bootloader (you'll see files with .UF2 extensions).
2. Navigate up one level, until you see the TRINKETBOOT icon.
3. Drag the .UF2 file out of the "Update CircuitPy version..." folder onto TRINKETBOOT. The Trinket will restart, loading the new version.
4. You can find the most updated version of CircuitPython here: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-trinket-m0-circuitpython-arduino?view=all#circuitpython
